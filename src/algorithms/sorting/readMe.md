# Sorting Algorithms

yeah... no interviewer is gonna ask for a specific sorting algorithm

if your time constraint is O(n^2) and constant space, use insertion sort or bubble sort
if your time constraint is O(nlogn) and O(n) space, use a minHeap and sort or use mergesort

I simply don't want to waste my time memorizing algorithms...in most cases mergesort is slightly faster than quicksort
so theres no point in using quicksort. In terms of O(n^2) algorithms, insertion sort is already using constant space
