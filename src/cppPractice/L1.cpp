// a class is a template or blueprint to represent an object

/*
    video questions below:

    1.) difference between an object and a class
        - a class represents an object, containing data memebers and function
   memebers (public or private)
        - an object however, is an instantiation of class, meaning it is a
   physical segmented memory where we can
        - assign attributes for that specifc object
    2.) data members vs. member functions
        - both can be public or private, members are primitive data types or
   objects belonging to a class
        - functions are things which get/set members, or they can do other
   things relating to the object 3.) implement an employee class, write a
   getter/setter for updating salary
